If you think I can be helpful with your project or you’d like to explore ideas together, feel free to shoot me an email. Collaborations are always welcome.

I often have ongoing or early-stage projects in AI systems and enjoy involving motivated undergraduates. If you’re interested, feel free to drop me an email with a brief introduction, your resume, and, if you’d like, your transcript and GitHub.
